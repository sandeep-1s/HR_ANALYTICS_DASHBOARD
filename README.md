### 1. **Project Overview**
   **Title:** HR Analytics Dashboard â€“ Analyzing Employee Attrition  
   **Description:**  
   This Power BI project dives into the attrition trends within an organization. The aim is to uncover patterns and insights from employee data to help HR teams make data-driven decisions for better retention. Key areas analyzed include education, age, salary, years at the company, job roles, and gender. The project helps to visualize factors affecting employee attrition and guides strategies to mitigate turnover.

### 2. **Tech Stack**
   - **Power BI** for creating interactive dashboards and data visualizations.
   - **Excel/CSV** files for data storage and preprocessing.
   - **DAX** (Data Analysis Expressions) for performing advanced calculations.
   - **Power Query** for data transformation and cleaning.
   - **SQL** (optional) for querying data from databases, if used.
   - **GitHub** for sharing and version control of the project.

### 3. **Power BI Techniques Learned**
   - **Data Import and Transformation:** Power Query was used to clean and transform the data for analysis.
   - **DAX Functions:** Calculations like total attrition, attrition rate, and more complex metrics were done using DAX.
   - **Interactive Visualizations:** Various types of charts like bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts were used to showcase different dimensions of attrition.
   - **Slicers and Filters:** These tools were implemented to allow HR teams to interact with the dashboard, filtering by education, age, gender, and more.
   - **Calculated Columns and Measures:** Key metrics like average tenure, salary ranges, and attrition rates were created for better insights.

### 4. **Questions to Solve**
   - **Attrition by Education:** Is there a correlation between employees' education levels and their likelihood of leaving the company?
   - **Attrition by Age:** At which age group do employees tend to leave the company most frequently?
   - **Attrition by Salary Slab:** Are there certain salary brackets where attrition is higher? How can salary adjustments impact retention?
   - **Attrition by Years at the Company:** When are employees most likely to leave based on their tenure? Can retention strategies be tailored around this?
   - **Attrition by Job Role:** Which job roles have the highest attrition rates, and why? How can the company focus on role-specific retention?
   - **Attrition by Gender:** Is there a noticeable difference in attrition rates between male and female employees? What actions can be taken to address any imbalances?
